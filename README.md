**Engineering the substrate of the decentralized web.** Currently, I am a Product Engineer at the **Solana Foundation**, focused on developing the tools and infrastructure that power the Solana ecosystem. My approach combines high-fidelity design with deep technical execution to create seamless user experiences.

With a history ranging from core DeFi contributions to strategic product design for high-growth startups, I focus on building modular, open-source solutions that scale.
